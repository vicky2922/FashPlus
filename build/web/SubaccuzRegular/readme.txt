- Subaccuz was first made for a "pilot" of a Tv show that may be produce in 2003.
The show was a blend between a suspense cop movie and a tv quizz. We based our research on old tv series with a psycho look and we ended discovering a movie produced in 1962 called "What ever happened to baby jane ?". We crated the font on the letters used in that title.
